# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- All sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use different keys for development and production
- Rotate keys regularly

### Database Security
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- User authentication and role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Prepared statements to prevent SQL injection

### Frontend Security
- Environment variables prefixed with `VITE_` for client-side access
- Sensitive operations require authentication
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping
- HTTPS enforcement in production
